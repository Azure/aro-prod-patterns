# Governance + Security Scenario

This section sets up and captures the scenario that we will be walking through over the next 2 days.

ContosoFinancial, a large Financial Services organization, provides banking and online services to its customers around the world. ContosoFinancial has 3 physical locations around the world (1 North America, 1 Western Europe, 1 Singapore) with each physical location connected to Azure via Express Route. They are also divided into 5 major lines of business, each with their own cost center.

ContosoFinancial is a mature Azure customer with the majority of their existing workloads spanning their on-prem datacenters and Cloud, mostly leveraging IaaS VMs today. They are looking to take the next step in their Azure journey and achieve a greater level of agility and flexibility through the adoption of Microservices and Containers. They also recognize that there is huge momentum in the industry towards containers and Kubernetes as the container orchestrator. They want to take advantage of that momentum while at the same time look to see if they can reduce some of the management and operations overhead that currently exists with their IaaS VMs today. This is the main reason that ContosoFinancial is looking at Azure Red Hat Openshift (ARO) as it aligns to their container strategy vision and is also a managed service which will help them reduce some of their existing technical debt around management and operations.

## Background

* Global Presence – Their customer base exists around the world so they will need presence in multiple countries/locations.
* High Availability – The customer workloads need to be highly available so that their customers are able to access their services such as online banking at anytime. They would like to know how they can handle scenarios where critical services/infrastructure in a particular region is unavailable for extended periods of time.
* Identity – ContosoFinancial is an existing O365 user today so they rely heavily on Azure AD for RBAC.
* Logging – The customer is currently using Log Analytics for their IaaS VM workloads and would like to continue to use that going forward for ARO if possible.
* Monitoring – ContosoFinancial uses DataDog today on*prem and would like to continue to use that with ARO so they have a single pane of glass. If we are recommending an alternative, help them understand how that migration is going to work.
* Alerting – ContosoFinancial would like to setup alerts so that key systems and components are monitored and reported upon when not functioning as expected. What are those key metrics?
* SIEM Integration – Security information needs to flow into QRadar, ContosoFinancial’s existing SIEM tool.
* Audit Reporting – In order to meet their regulatory needs, ContosoFinancial needs an audit of all requests made to ARO.
* Container Registry – Currently use Artifactory today for storing container images.
* Cost Mgmt – How does chargeback to the 5 different lines of business work?
* On-prem Connectivity – Although ContosoFinancial has moved a large majority of their workloads to the Cloud, there is still connectivity back to on-prem required. Connectivity back to on-prem requires getting IPs whitelisted to access certain services, as well as cert-based AuthN.
* Secrets Mgmt – ConstoFinancial uses Azure Key Vault today for storing secrets, certs and keys for disk encryption for example. What is the recommended way to expose sensitive information to the running containers?
* Certificate Authority (CA) – The desire is to leverage ContosoFinancials own CA when possible.
* Existing Azure Network – ConstosoFinancial has adopted a hub and spoke VNET architecture aligned to Virtual Data Center (VDC).
* On-prem to Cloud Connectivity with Express Route (ER) – Address space 10.0.0.0/16 is currently used on-premises and extended out to Azure through ER. 
* Share Clusters – ContosoFinancial wants to share a cluster out to multiple parties so need to be able to carve the resources up into logical buckets and secure access between projects/teams.
* Container Registry – ContosoFinancial is currently partial to Artifactory as their container image repository as it provides the ability to have a single store that can be segmented via AuthZ using RBAC.
* Container Scanning – ContosoFinancial needs to be able to scan images as part of their DevOps pipeline along with scanning images at runtime for potential threats.
* Package Management – Looking for a process or tool to be able to easily deploy services to multiple environments.
* No Public IPs – ContosoFinancial does not want any public endpoints such as control plane endpoints or ssh access to any of the nodes. The only exception to this requirement is Public IPs for public-facing workloads such as mobile app API backends.
* Blue/Green Deployments – ContosoFinancial wants to know the recommended practices with respect to ARO around doing blue/green deployment.
* Phased Rollouts – ContosoFinancial wants to know the How-To implement blue/green deployment with phased rollouts and rollback capabilities?

## Areas of Responsibility

This section describes who does what in the organization (e.g. who is using DataDog and why, who is using the SIEM, does the cloud architecture team review and bless an architecture and ensure it complies with internal policies/compliance requirements as set forth by the security/compliance team).

* Organization - ContosoFinancial has a cloud architecture team that works closely with IT, security, SecOps, compliance, identity, networking and application teams as Lines of business wish to deploy systems into Azure.  The responsibilities are structured as follows:
* Cloud architecture team: Responsible for understanding all of the Azure components - their function, integration, controls, and monitoring capabilities and how they can be integrated to meet both functional and security/compliance requirements.  They coordinate with and have representation from the IT, security, SecOps, compliance, identity and networking teams.  They work with lines of business from idea through deployment into production.  Their workflow aligns to Contoso's SDL process.
* IT team:  Responsible for the deployment and day to day operations of the Azure environment
* Security team:  Responsible for reviewing individual Azure services as Lines of Business want to use them from a controls/visibility perspective and maintain a "service catalog" of the required configuration of services that can be used based on data sensitivity (a service catalog).  Such configurations may include required authentication method, authorization configuration, network connectivity to/from, encryption configuration and encryption key management, and monitoring requirements for any proposed service.  They are responsible for translating these into operational controls as well (e.g. Azure Policies).  They are responsible for reviewing proposed Azure architectures to verify they meet Contoso's security requirements as part of the Cloud architecture's SDL process. They are responsible for evaluating and presenting a risk to the Lines of Business when a proposed architecture falls outside of established services/architectures.
* Security Operations (SecOps) team:  Responsible for the operationalizing and operation of the security of the Azure environment for Contoso.  This includes monitoring (using native tools and their SIEM) as well as Incident response planning.
* Compliance team:  Responsible for ensuring regulatory and industry compliance standards are met.  They work closely with the Security team and Cloud architecture team to flow down control and monitoring/auditing requirements and review designs to ensure they can be met.
* Identity team:  Responsible for Identity and Access Management for the Azure environment, working closely with the Security and Cloud Architecture team for use of AAD, Role Based Access Controls (RBAC), IAM segmentation, use of and monitoring service principles for service access, application-level access (Internal, B2B, and B2C), and VM level access/Roles.  They work closely with the security and SecOps team to ensure requirements and appropriate controls/monitoring are in place across their responsible areas.
* Networking team:  Responsible for all networking for Contoso including control/monitoring of physical and virtual networking systems.  They are solely responsible for VNETs in Azure, Azure networking services (both first and third party) as well as connectivity to/from Corpnet.

We have also been discussing of starting a "Cloud Native Customer Advisory Board". So, I wanted to see if your PG team would be open to help faciliate those discussions. Essentially Kendall and I would do all the
leg work to get it setup and make sure we invite the right customers. What we would ask of your PG team would be in attendance and hold open conversations with customers. Let me know what you think?
